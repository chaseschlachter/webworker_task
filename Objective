// Hi Vishal
// Objective - I need the webworker to call the `test()` function in showPageValidate.js on time, even after the browser goes inactive
// and throttles time, preventing something like setInterval() from properly working over longer periods.

// The timer for the call is set at one day and 15 minutes, although you can shorten to test the code
// (it just has to be longer than a browser timeout).

// The webworker timer should successfully print out "worked" on the show.ejs page console
// after the timer goes off.
